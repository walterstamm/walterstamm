### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I currently work at Seidor Analytics with the position of Software Engineer. This does not mean that I know everything, it is even more so that I consider that I        have little experience, but that I am open and willing to learn new technologies based on what the project needs.

- ðŸ‘¯ I love developing, if it's in the Web area I prefer the dark side ahaha I feel more comfortable with the Back than with the Front, but if something needs to be done       in the Front, let's go ahead!
